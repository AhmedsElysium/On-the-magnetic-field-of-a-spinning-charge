Magnetic Field of a spinning charged sphere

This paper was made for a project in vector calculus to model the magnetic field of a spinning charged sphere. This problem is well known and cannot be solved through the normal method of brute force through biot-savart analytically. We chose to compare the analytic solution through vector potential and numerical solution through MATLAB and COMSOL.
